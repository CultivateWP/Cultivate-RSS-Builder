- Add option for "exclude posts published since". Useful for creating a feed of updated posts and excluding any newly published posts (see README).

## [1.0.0] = 2023-07-21
- Initial release. Forked from older plugin, BE RSS Builder. Option names left the same so previously built RSS feeds continue working after upgrading from BE RSS Builder.
